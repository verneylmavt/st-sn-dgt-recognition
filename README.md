# üî¢ Single Digit Recognition Model Collections

This repository contains machine learning models of Single Digit Recognition, designed to be deployed using ONNX and utilized in a Streamlit-based web application. The app provides an interactive interface for performing this task using neural network architectures. [Check here to see other ML tasks](https://github.com/verneylmavt/ml-model).

For more information about the training process, please check the `.ipynb` files in the `training` folder.

## üéà Demo App
